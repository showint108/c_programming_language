# modulus
The modulus operator (`%`) calculates the remainder when one integer is divided by another. 
For example, `10 % 3` equals `1` because `10` divided by `3` is `3` with a remainder of `1`.
Modulus is useful in various applications, such as determining if a number is even or odd (`x % 2` will be `0` for even numbers and `1` for odd numbers)
It's important to note that the modulus operator is typically used with integers and may not work as expected with floating-point numbers in some programming languages.


# increment and decrement operators

In programming, the increment operator (`++`) is used to increase the value of a variable by 1. There are two forms of the increment operator: postfix (`x++`) and prefix (`++x`).

1. **Postfix Increment (`x++`)**:
   - The current value of `x` is used in an expression.
   - After the value is used, `x` is incremented by 1.
   - For example, if `x` is initially `5`, `y = x++;` would set `y` to `5` and then increment `x` to `6`.

2. **Prefix Increment (`++x`)**:
   - `x` is incremented by 1.
   - The updated value of `x` is then used in an expression.
   - For example, if `x` is initially `5`, `y = ++x;` would increment `x` to `6` and set `y` to `6`.

In summary:
- `x++` uses the current value and then increments `x`.
- `++x` increments `x` first and then uses the updated value.

Both forms are commonly used in loops and other control structures in programming to modify variables. The choice between `x++` and `++x` depends on whether you want to use the current value or the updated value of the variable in your expressions.

# augmented assignment operator

Augmented assignment operators are shortcuts in programming that perform an operation on a variable and then assign the result back to the same variable. For example, `+=` adds the value on the right to the variable on the left and assigns the result back to the variable.

Here are some common augmented assignment operators:

- **`+=`**: Adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
  - Example: `x += 5;` is the same as `x = x + 5;`

- **`-=`**: Subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
  - Example: `x -= 3;` is the same as `x = x - 3;`

- **`*=`**: Multiplies the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
  - Example: `x *= 2;` is the same as `x = x * 2;`

- **`/=`**: Divides the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
  - Example: `x /= 4;` is the same as `x = x / 4;`

- **`%=`**: Calculates the modulus of the left operand divided by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
  - Example: `x %= 3;` is the same as `x = x % 3;`

These operators are concise ways to modify variables in place, often used in loops and other situations where you want to update a variable based on its current value.
